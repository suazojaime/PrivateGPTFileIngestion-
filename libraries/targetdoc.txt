This file contains documentation for mstarrun targets. This documentation
is included into the HTML produced by targetsHtml. The text here is copied
without processing, so you can include arbitrary HTML and expect it to work.
If you want to include images, you can put them in the the bus/mstarrun 
directory (where this file is), and they should be found from there.

[targets]
The targets target prints a list of all possible targets and descriptions of those targets if they are available.
To define

[sanityCheck]
The sanity checker is a tool to check that mstarrun target definitions at least look sensible.
It checks to make sure that:
<UL>
<LI>Each target has a 'filename' subkey
<LI>Each target has a 'description' subkey
<LI>Certain subkeys which are almost always mistakes (mis-spellings of others) are not defined
<LI>Subkeys don't have . in them
<LI>Files referred to by filename subkeys exist
<LI>Targets are not defined in multiple files
</ul>
Most of these problems are not absolutely fatal, but they are confusing or below standard.

[echo]
Use echo for debugging variable settings.
For example, to find out for sure which MSTAR_HOME you are using, do
<PRE>
mstarrun echo "{MSTAR_HOME}"
</PRE>
Strings are interpreted as paths, so they will have their slashes/backslashes turned around to the right
direction, and ".." will be eliminated wherever possible.
